# 🌿 Git Guide

This project follows a **GitHub Flow–based workflow** with strict naming conventions to keep collaboration clean, predictable, and scalable.

---

# 📌 Core Principle

> Git is not just version control — it is communication.

Every branch and commit should clearly describe intent.

---

# 🧭 Branch Strategy

We use **short-lived branches** created from `main`.

```text
main
 ├── feature/*
 ├── bugfix/*
 ├── hotfix/*
 ├── refactor/*
 ├── docs/*
 ├── test/*
 └── chore/*
```

---

# 🌱 Branch Naming Convention

## Format

```
type/short-description
```

Optional:

```
type/ticket-id-short-description
```

---

## Allowed Characters

- lowercase letters
- numbers
- hyphens (-)
- slash (/)

---

## Examples

### Feature

```
feature/login
feature/user-profile
feature/auth-refresh-token
```

### Bugfix

```
bugfix/login-redirect-loop
bugfix/token-expired-error
```

### Hotfix (production urgent)

```
hotfix/payment-failure
hotfix/security-patch
```

### Refactor

```
refactor/auth-service
refactor/api-layer
```

### Docs

```
docs/readme-update
docs/api-guide
```

### Chore

```
chore/update-dependencies
chore/remove-unused-code
```

---

## ❌ Avoid

```
Feature/LoginPage
fix1
my-branch
update
John-branch
```

---

# 🔄 Workflow

```text
1. Pull latest main
2. Create branch
3. Develop feature
4. Commit changes
5. Push branch
6. Open Pull Request
7. Code review
8. Merge to main
```

---

# 📥 Start New Work

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main

git checkout -b feature/login
```

---

# 🔁 Keep Branch Updated

Prefer **rebase** for clean history.

```bash
git fetch origin

git rebase origin/main
```

OR merge if your team prefers:

```bash
git merge origin/main
```

---

# 🧾 Commit Convention

We use **Conventional Commits**.

## Format

```
type(scope): description
```

---

## Types

```
feat     → new feature
fix      → bug fix
refactor → code change (no behavior change)
docs     → documentation
test     → tests
chore    → maintenance
style    → formatting only
perf     → performance improvement
ci       → CI/CD changes
build    → build system changes
```

---

## Examples

```
feat(auth): add login with email
fix(api): handle unauthorized response
refactor(user): simplify mapper
docs: update contributing guide
test(auth): add login tests
chore: upgrade dependencies
```

---

## ❌ Bad commits

```
fix stuff
update
changes
final commit
```

---

# 🚀 Pull Request Flow

## PR Title

Good:

```
Add login authentication flow
Fix leaderboard pagination
Improve API error handling
```

Bad:

```
fix
update

```

---

# ✅ Before Opening PR

- [ ] Code builds successfully
- [ ] Lint passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No unused logs
- [ ] Code follows CODING_GUIDE
- [ ] Branch is up to date with main

---

# 👀 Code Review Rules

Review focuses on:

- Correctness
- Readability
- Maintainability
- Performance
- Security
- Test coverage

---

# 🔥 Merge Rules

- Never push directly to `main`
- All changes go through PR
- Require at least 1 review (recommended)
- Squash merge preferred (optional policy)

---

# 🧹 Branch Cleanup

After merge:

```bash
git branch -d feature/login
git push origin --delete feature/login
```

---

# ⚠️ Rules

## Do NOT

- commit secrets
- push `.env`
- commit `node_modules`
- force push to shared branches
- commit broken code to main

---

# 🧠 Best Practices

- Keep branches small and focused
- One feature = one branch
- Commit often, but meaningfully
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Rebase before PR
- Keep PRs small and reviewable

---

# 📌 Why This Matters

Consistent Git practices:

- improve collaboration
- reduce merge conflicts
- speed up code review
- make history readable
- support CI/CD automation

---

# ✔️ Summary

If you're unsure:

> Keep branch small, commit clean, PR simple.
